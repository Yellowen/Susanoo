# Installation
`Susanoo`'s installation is fairly easy:

```bash
$ gem install susanoo
```

If you're not using ruby versions manager scripts like `rbenv` or `rvm` (which I totally recommend you to use
`rbenv`) install `Susanoo` using `sudo` or `root` user.

## Requirements

Before contrinue make sure to install requirements of `Susanoo`. Here is the list:

* NodeJS + npm
* Install Apache Cordova using `npm` globally (version 3.5 or higher)

  platform (e.g android)
